# Cotti the Knight

**Cotti the Knight** is a 2D platformer game where you play as a brave knight exploring a colorful fantasy world. Jump, collect coins, and try to reach the end of the level while avoiding obstacles.  

This game was created as my **first real game development project**. The goal was to learn the full process of making and finishing a game, from movement and collisions to sounds and scoring.
